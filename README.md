### Design challenge
We've intentionally made this design challenge a little open ended. We'll evaluate your work at the end of 2 hours, so be sure to push a commit at the 2h mark. If you want to continue working past 2h that's cool, and if you do we'd love to see what you've done, but it's absolutely not expected or required.
1. Create a new [mirror/copy](https://help.github.com/en/articles/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository) of this repo on Github. **Make your repo private!** so that other candidates can't view your solutions.
2. Get the app running locally.
3. See the list of build kit options at the bottom? It's sure ugly. Can you make it nicer to look at?
4. How will the current layout look on a mobile device? Can you adjust the layout so that it works across screen sizes?
5. It would be nice if customers knew the build kits' price. It's in the data structure returned from the API, so let's find a good place to add it to the display.
6. When you're done, or at the end of 2 hours, be sure to push your progress to your github repo, and share access with github user scb-mchaines (that's me!) so we can check out your awesome design work.

## Running the app
### Install dependencies
- First, you'll need NodeJS (which will come with npm). Download it from https://nodejs.org/en/
- From in the santa-cruz-design-challenge directory, run `npm install`
- Start the app with `npm start`
- This should launch a server on http://localhost:3000 which you can view in your browser.
    - The page will automatically reload when you save changes in the project.

#### Tips
- You may add or change whatever files you deem necessary, but you should be able to make considerable progress focusing only in `src/App.js` and `src/App.css`.
- If you don't know React yet, don't sweat. You shouldn't really need to make changes to the React code to complete this challenge. All of the markup is in App.js and you can style those JSX elements just like they're HTML.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
